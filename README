This layer provides recipes needed to build fwupd within OpenEmbedded.

The fwupd recipe supports many different plugins for various hardware. Due to
the wide variety of hardware and the desire of many OE users to build minimal
images, the recipe disables all optional plugins by default. It may be
necessary to enable various PACKAGECONFIG options to obtain the desired
behavior on a specific platform.
